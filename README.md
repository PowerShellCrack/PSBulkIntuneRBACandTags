# Bulk Intune RBAC Role and Tag creation script

This script is written using Microsoft Graph api calls to creates and assign Azure Entra groups and Tags to Intune RBAC Roles.

## Requirements

### Modules

- Microsoft.Graph.Authentication
- Microsoft.Graph.Applications
- Az.Accounts
- IDMCmdlets

### Site list

Site Code|Region|Area
|--|--|--|
|Required (a)|Required (a)|Required (a)|

### Scope Tag with Assignment List

- Must be in csv format. Can be generated using _GenerateScopeGroups.ps1_ script. Columns used are:

Region|Area|Device Type|Scope Tags|Scope Groups|Criteria
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|Required (a)|Required (a)|Optional (f)|Required|Required|Required (c)|


### RBAC list

- Must be in csv format. Can be exported using from _CBP Intune Management Tags Groups Roles.xlsx_. Columns used are:

Org|Region|Area|Role Definition|Role|Included Tag #|Scope Tags|Member Group|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|Required|Required (a)|Required (a)|Optional (d)|Required|Required (b)|Required|Optional (e)|


### Key

- (a) --> Used to match corresponding role with tag
- (b) --> At least one tag is needed, increment column # (eg. Included Tag 1, Included Tag 2, etc)
- (c) --> Length cannot be more that 3072 characters (Azure limitation)
- (d) --> If defined, will use that for permissions set, vs looking at Role
- (e) --> If not provided, will default to scripts parameter _DefaultAdminAADGroup_
- (f) --> Specifying a device type will align with device filter; otherwise filter will look in Scope tag for matches

## Scripts

- __GenerateScopeGroups.ps1__ --> Export a the ScopeTagAndAssignments.csv based on Site data
- __IntuneRolesCreation.ps1__ --> Creates and assigns Azure Entra groups, Tags and Intune RBAC Roles based comma-delimited list
- __IntuneRolesDeletion.ps1__ --> Deletes Azure Entra groups, Tags and Intune RBAC Roles based comma-delimited list


### Parameters

|Parameter | Value Type | Explanation | Creation Script | Deletion Script | Generate Script|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| GraphAdminUPN| UPN | Provides UPN to authenticate to Graph. MFA/Password screen may popup behind script | x | x ||
| RbacListPath | CSV | Default value is _.\ManagementRoles.csv_. Specify full path to csv file | x | x ||
| TagAndAssignmentListPath | CSV | Default value is _.\ScopeTagAndAssignments.csv_. Specify full path to csv file | x | x | x |
| SourceListPath | CSV | Specify full path to csv file for Site data ||| x |
| DefaultAdminAADGroup | string | Default value is 'SG-AZ-EndpointMgr-Admins'. If group is not found in Azure Entra, script will prompt to create it as user assigned type | x | ||
| DeviceFilter | array | Must be an Array _eg. @('Windows'), @('Windows','Android')_.<br>- Values that can be used are: _'Windows','macOS','iPhone','iPad','Android','SurfaceHub','TeamsRoom','TeamsPhone'_.<br>-  Values should corresponding with ending of Tags and ending of Azure Entra groups in csv lists. This will filter the creation of Azure Entra groups as well as assigning tags.<br> __See Work Around__ | x ||
| SkipRoleAssignment | switch |  Skips the role assignment enumeration. No roles will be assigned to their respective Azure Entra group |x|||
| SkipRoleTags | switch | Skips the tagging Roles and in the assignments. Tagging roles allows member to view Role and its assignment |x|||
| NoPrompt | switch | Does not ask to create Azure Entra member groups; would prompt for DefaultAdminAADGroup and when 'Member Group' column is populated |x|||
| NoAction | switch | Does nothing and simulates action using _Whatif_ like output ||x||
| Verbose | switch | Very noisy but does output additional information | x | x | x |


### Example Calls

```powershell
# GENERATE EXAMPLE 1
#Run script using SiteList.sample.csv
.\GenerateScopeGroups.ps1 -DataListPath '.\SampleData\SiteList.sample.csv'

# CREATE EXAMPLE 1
#Run script using default values (graph UPN required)
.\IntuneRolesCreation.ps1 -GraphAdminUPN 'admin@yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com'

# CREATE EXAMPLE 2
#Run script using default csv but assign Role members to specified Azure AAD group
.\IntuneRolesCreation.ps1 -GraphAdminUPN 'admin@yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com' -DefaultAdminAADGroup "SG-FTE-EndpointMgr-Admins"

# CREATE EXAMPLE 3
#Run script using specified csv files
.\IntuneRolesCreation.ps1 -GraphAdminUPN 'admin@yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com' -RbacListPath '.\SampleData\ManagementRolesSample.csv' -TagAndAssignmentListPath '.\ScopeTagAndAssignmentsSample.csv'

# CREATE EXAMPLE 4
#Run script using specified csv files and filter only groups with 'Windows' in the name
.\IntuneRolesCreation.ps1 -GraphAdminUPN 'admin@yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com' -RbacListPath '.\SampleData\ManagementRolesSample.csv' -TagAndAssignmentListPath '.\SampleData\ScopeTagAndAssignmentsSample.csv' -DeviceFilter @('Windows')

# CREATE EXAMPLE 5
#Run script using specified csv files but don't assign Roles to Azure Entra groups
.\IntuneRolesCreation.ps1 -GraphAdminUPN 'admin@yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com' -RbacListPath '.\SampleData\ManagementRolesSample.csv' -TagAndAssignmentListPath '.\SampleData\ScopeTagAndAssignmentsSample.csv' -SkipRoleAssignment

# CREATE EXAMPLE 6
#Run script using specified csv files but don't assign tags to RBAC Roles
.\IntuneRolesCreation.ps1 -GraphAdminUPN 'admin@yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com' -RbacListPath '.\SampleData\ManagementRolesSample.csv' -TagAndAssignmentListPath '.\SampleData\ScopeTagAndAssignmentsSample.csv' -SkipRoleTags
```

### Outputs

- Displays status of each group tag and role.
- Displays simple report at end of run
- If error happens during _Role_ Creation; an error csv file will be created (name will follow csv name with appended date)
- If error happens during _Tag_ Creation; an error csv file will be created (name will follow csv name with appended date)
- If error happens during _Azure Entra group_ Creation; an error csv file will be created (name will follow csv name with appended date)


## Known Issues & Work Around

|Issue | Work Around |
|--|--|
|Script can take a while to generate object in Azure and Intune; Graph token may expire during script and cause failures| Mitigation's have been added to check expiration time during every item creation. If it exceeds expiration the script attempt re-authorization|
|By default all device type groups will be assign to Role as one assignment.|Running the script per device will group each assignment in their respective assignment name in the Roles|

## Notes

- Designed to be ran __ONCE__; however it can be ran multiple times to add missing roles, tags, groups, and/or assignments. It will check for already created objects and attempt to update them except for assigned Roles
